# ðŸ“– Introduction to Machine Learning

Imagine that you want to sell a car. You don't know how much it costs. You don't want to put a price that is too high because you will not sell it. You don't want to put a price that is too low because you will lose money.

In this case, you search in the internet and find a website that sells cars. You find a car that is similar to yours but with different characteristics.

| Year | Make | Mileage | ... | Price |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | --- | ----- |
| 1995 | Gaz  | 200.000 | ... | $1.1k |
| 1980 | Vaz  | 100.000 | ... | $0.6k |
| 2016 | Bwm  | 5.000   | ... | $23k  |

Using this informations, a machine learning model can be created to predict the price of your car. The information like year, make, and mileage are called **features** (what we know). The price is called the **target** (what we want).
